A bunch of simple javascript challenges for teaching at Melbourne Code Mentoring

## Instructions for use

With node/npm already installed on your machine, run: 

```
npm install
```

and then

```
npm test
```

Then you may need to press 'a' to run all the tests - and see that they are failing. 

Your task is to populate the functions in index.js such that the tests pass. 

## Issues with Windows

I've encountered some issues with Windows getting this running. 

If you know how to solve these - please get in touch. 

The issues are: 

1. `npm test` gives a `jest not recognized as an internal command` or whatever message - even though npm should be aware the dev dependency.

2. Jest doesn't give an interactive CLI - it will say 'no changes detected since last commit' - and where you should be able to press 'a' to run all - it won't let you.
